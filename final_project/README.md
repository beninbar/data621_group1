## Proposal

### Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project (THEOP)
https://opr.princeton.edu/archive/theop/

The Texas Highest Education Opportunity Project (THEOP) studies college planning and enrollment behavior under the 1998 Texas policy guaranteeing admission to any public university for high school seniors graduating in the top decile of their class. 

There are two distinct datasets that are a part of this study; **Administrative** data that summarize student-level admissions and academic performance from nine Texas public colleges and universitites, and longitudinal **Survey** data of Texas high school sophmores and seniors exploring their post-high school goals and activities.

Access to this dataset is being provided by the Office of Population Research at Princeton University.  https://pop.princeton.edu

### Research Questions

At this time we are exploring the data to identify viable research questions that could be modeled.  Our initial instinct is to avoid relying heavily on Survey data which can be highly varied and difficult to quantify.  

Potential questions we might explore with the Administrative data include:

- Did students admitted under the TX top decile rule over/underperform their peers academically?  (GPA, graduation status, time to graduation, etc.)Â 
- Were standardized test scores predictive of college academic performance? 
- Were High School economic status rankings predictive of college academic performance?

As we gain greater familiarity with these datasets and survey the literature for current approaches for handling and analyzing similar studies, we will update our proposal with more finely-tuned research questions.
